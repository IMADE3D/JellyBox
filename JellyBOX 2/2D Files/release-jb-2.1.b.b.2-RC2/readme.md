The master for geometry is an Illustrator file (.ai), but the master for production are Rdworks (.rld) files. The ai files do _not_ contain all the informations, but only the shapes and colors. Line processing like dotted line, dashed line... is done in RDworks and is contained in the .rld files. 
If you can, we recommend you use RDworks with your laser. 
If you can't then still download RDworks, and use the Preview function to see what all the settings do so you can replicate it in your laser host.
