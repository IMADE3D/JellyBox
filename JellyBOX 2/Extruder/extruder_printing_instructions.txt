This file is pre-sliced for PETG on a JellyBOX Original or 2.

To print in other materials, use the open the included 3mf Cura project file in the latest Cura IMADE3D Edition (go.imade3d.com/cura-download) and edit the settings to your liking. 

Alternatively, open the gcode in text editor and change the temperatures...

You can also slice the stl yourself, but beware that this file uses advanced techniques (local override of inner settings) to get a locally stronger print.
