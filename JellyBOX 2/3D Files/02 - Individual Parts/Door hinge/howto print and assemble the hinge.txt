We print these from PETG. 

Use 3 perimeters around the hinge part itself to achieve maximum stiffness. Depending on your extruder’s calibration, you may also need to tweak the flow to achieve a tight fit. 

We use a piece of 1.75mm PETG filament as the hinge pin!

1. Heat up something to 100 °C or more. Touch one end of a piece of filament to it so it melts and creates a little plug at the end. use a piece of metal (your IMADE3D wrench for example) to smoothen the plug. 
2. Insert into the hinge. 
3. Trim the filament so that about 2mm are sticking out. 
4. Melt and squash the other side of the filament to seal the pin in the hinge. 
5. Tadaaa.
