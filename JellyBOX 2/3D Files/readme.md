JellyBOX 3D printed parts are produced from PETG.

PETG is stringier and little worse behaved than PLA and demands a heated build plate, but it's mechanically superior and withstands higher temperatures. Warning: keep your PETG dry as it's hydrophilic and that destroys print strength. Look it up online if you don't know what we mean.

PLA will work for all of these parts most of the time, but you may need to print a repair more often as PLA is more brittle, less temperature resistant, and finally experiences creep under load. 

The few parts that really benefit from PETG even short term (not just long term or when in a hot car) are all the fan shrouds which are close to the hotend. 

The gcodes provided are sliced for PETG (!). Cura project files are included (.3mf). You can open these files and re-slice for another material (recommended) or export stl and slice differently altogether. Beware that many slices are optimized with very specific settings and modifier meshes. 

You could also do search and replace on the gcodes to make a workable pla gcode' see this discussion for more details
