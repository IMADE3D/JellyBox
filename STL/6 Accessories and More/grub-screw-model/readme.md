# About Grub Screw Model

- this part is made to demonstrate how the grub screw must go against the **flat** side of the motor shaft to properly _Grub_ it. 
- this is relevant to motor pulleys and the drive gear
- people have troubles seeing this concept because the grub screws are so tiny; hence this model. 

# Usage
- Print in PLA (perfectly fine) or PETG.
- Use body-cut for testing the print settings and fit of the screw in the body - it's way faster to print
- you can play with flow, or, arguably better, simply uniformly resize by 1-2% as needed to adjust the tolerance between the parts
